Core Hours and Availability

Core Hours

- Exceptions require VP approval

Communication Expectations

Response Times
- Slack messages: Within 2 hours during core hours
- Email: Within 4 hours during core hours
- Urgent issues (marked as such): Within 30 minutes
- Out of office: Set status and delegate critical responsibilities

Meeting Guidelines

- Join from quiet location
- Mute when not speaking in large meetings

Status Updates

Collaboration and Culture

Virtual Team Building

Over-Communication is Encouraged
In remote settings, it's better to over-communicate:
- Share progress updates proactively
- Document decisions and discussions
- Make work visible to team
- Ask questions when unclear

Performance and Accountability

Remote work does not change performance expectations:
- Same deliverables and deadlines as office workers
- Regular 1:1s with manager (weekly or bi-weekly)
- Quarterly performance reviews
- Career development opportunities equal to office workers

Productivity is measured by output and impact, not hours online or response time outside core hours.
