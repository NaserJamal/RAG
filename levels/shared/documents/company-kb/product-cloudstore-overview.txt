CloudStore - Product Overview and Documentation

Version 2.4 | Last Updated: January 2025

Introduction

CloudStore is TechCorp's flagship distributed object storage platform designed for modern cloud-native applications. It provides scalable, durable, and highly available storage with enterprise-grade security and compliance features.

Key Features

Scalability
- Seamlessly scale from gigabytes to exabytes without downtime

- Automatic replication across multiple availability zones
- Configurable replication policies (2x, 3x, or geo-redundant)
- Self-healing architecture detects and repairs corrupt data

Performance
- Low-latency object access (typically <100ms)
- Intelligent caching at edge locations
- Multipart upload for large files (up to 5TB per object)
- Parallel download for high-throughput retrieval
- Range requests for partial object retrieval

Security
- Encryption at rest using AES-256
- Encryption in transit via TLS 1.3
- Fine-grained access control using IAM policies
- Support for customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)
- Audit logging for all API operations
- SOC 2, ISO 27001, and HIPAA compliant

Use Cases

Media Storage and Distribution
CloudStore excels at storing and serving media files:
- Video streaming platforms can store and distribute content globally
- CDN integration for low-latency delivery to end users
- Support for adaptive bitrate streaming
- Automatic thumbnail generation and image optimization (CloudStore Vision add-on)

Backup and Archival
Reliable long-term storage for backups and archives:
- Lifecycle policies automatically transition data to lower-cost storage tiers
- Immutable backups with object lock (prevents deletion for specified retention period)
- Integration with popular backup tools (Veeam, Commvault, Rubrik)
- Point-in-time recovery with versioning enabled

Data Lakes and Analytics
Foundation for big data and analytics workloads:
- Store structured and unstructured data at any scale
- Native integration with CloudAnalytics and Apache Spark
- Partition pruning for efficient querying
- Support for Parquet, ORC, and Avro formats

Application Data Storage
Backend storage for cloud applications:
- User-generated content (photos, documents, uploads)
- Static website hosting
- Log aggregation and storage
- Database backups and disaster recovery

Storage Classes

CloudStore Standard
- Default storage class for frequently accessed data
- $0.023 per GB/month
- No retrieval fees
- 99.99% availability SLA

CloudStore Infrequent Access (IA)
- For data accessed less than once per month
- $0.013 per GB/month
- $0.01 per GB retrieval fee
- 99.5% availability SLA
- Minimum storage duration: 30 days

CloudStore Archive
- Ultra-low-cost storage for long-term archival
- $0.004 per GB/month
- Retrieval time: 3-5 hours (standard), 5-12 hours (bulk)
- $0.02 per GB retrieval fee
- Minimum storage duration: 90 days

CloudStore Archive Deep
- Lowest-cost option for rarely accessed data
- $0.001 per GB/month
- Retrieval time: 12-48 hours
- $0.04 per GB retrieval fee
- Minimum storage duration: 180 days

Lifecycle Management

Automatically transition objects between storage classes or delete them based on rules:

Example lifecycle policy:
- Transition to IA after 30 days
- Transition to Archive after 90 days
- Delete objects older than 7 years

This can reduce storage costs by 90% for aging data.

Data Transfer and Access

API Access
CloudStore provides RESTful APIs compatible with industry standards:
- S3-compatible API (easy migration from AWS S3)
- Native CloudStore API with additional features
- SDKs available for Python, Java, Go, Node.js, .NET, Ruby
- CLI tool for command-line operations

Data Transfer Methods
- Upload via web console (for files up to 5GB)
- API/SDK uploads (recommended for automation)
- CloudStore Transfer Service for bulk migrations (petabyte-scale)
- Direct Connect for high-bandwidth dedicated connections
- Edge locations for ingress optimization

Bandwidth Pricing
- Ingress: Free
- Egress to internet: $0.08 per GB (first 10TB/month)
- Egress to CloudAnalytics: Free
- Egress to same-region services: Free

Versioning and Object Lock

Versioning
Enable versioning on buckets to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object:
- Protects against accidental deletion
- Enables rollback to previous versions
- Each version has a unique version ID
- Can be suspended without deleting existing versions

Object Lock
WORM (Write Once, Read Many) storage for compliance:
- Governance mode: Prevents deletion except by privileged users
- Compliance mode: No one can delete or modify during retention period
- Legal hold: Indefinite retention until explicitly removed
- Required for SEC 17a-4, FINRA, and CFTC compliance

Monitoring and Analytics

CloudStore provides comprehensive monitoring:
- Storage usage metrics (total size, object count, request rates)
- Access patterns and hot/cold data analysis
- Cost analysis and optimization recommendations
- Real-time alerts for unusual access patterns or errors
- Integration with CloudWatch and Grafana

Best Practices

Naming Conventions
- Use meaningful bucket names: company-data-prod, user-uploads-staging
- Avoid sequential naming patterns for high-throughput workloads
- Include environment identifiers (prod, staging, dev)

Performance Optimization
- Use multipart upload for files over 100MB
- Implement exponential backoff for retry logic
- Distribute load using randomized prefixes for high-request-rate scenarios
- Enable CloudStore Transfer Acceleration for global uploads

Cost Optimization
- Implement lifecycle policies to transition aging data
- Delete incomplete multipart uploads (can accumulate costs)
- Use CloudStore IA for infrequent access patterns
- Monitor and delete unused buckets
- Use compression before uploading when appropriate

Security Best Practices
- Enable default encryption on all buckets
- Use least-privilege IAM policies
- Enable MFA delete for critical buckets
- Regularly review bucket policies and access logs
- Use VPC endpoints for private connectivity
- Enable server access logging

Getting Started

1. Create a bucket via web console or API
2. Configure appropriate permissions and encryption
3. Upload objects using SDK or CLI
4. Set up lifecycle policies for cost optimization
5. Enable monitoring and alerts
