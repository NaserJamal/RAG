TechCorp Vacation and Time Off Policy

Last Updated: January 2025

Overview
TechCorp values work-life balance and recognizes the importance of time away from work to recharge and spend time with loved ones. This document outlines our comprehensive vacation and paid time off (PTO) policies.

Annual Vacation Allowance
All full-time employees are entitled to paid vacation days based on their tenure with the company:

- Years 0-2: 15 vacation days per year
- Years 3-5: 20 vacation days per year
- Years 6-10: 25 vacation days per year
- Years 11+: 30 vacation days per year

Part-time employees receive prorated vacation days based on their scheduled hours.

Requesting Time Off
To request vacation time, employees must:

1. Submit a request through the HR Portal at least 2 weeks in advance for trips of 5 days or less
2. Submit requests at least 4 weeks in advance for trips longer than 5 days
3. Receive approval from their direct manager before making travel arrangements
4. Ensure adequate coverage is arranged for their responsibilities during absence

Peak blackout periods (typically end of fiscal quarters) may have restricted approval, so plan accordingly.

Carryover Policy
Employees may carry over up to 5 unused vacation days to the following calendar year. Any days beyond this limit will be forfeited. We encourage employees to use their full vacation allocation each year for wellness purposes.

The company does not provide cash compensation for unused vacation days except in cases of termination, where unused days will be paid out in the final paycheck.

Sick Leave
In addition to vacation days, all employees receive:

- 10 paid sick days per year
- Sick days do not roll over to the next year
- No doctor's note required for absences of 3 days or less
- Medical documentation required for absences exceeding 3 consecutive days

Sick leave should be used for personal illness, medical appointments, or caring for immediate family members who are ill.

Holidays
TechCorp observes the following paid holidays:

- New Year's Day
- Martin Luther King Jr. Day
- Presidents' Day
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving Day and the following Friday
- Christmas Eve and Christmas Day
- Two floating holidays (employee's choice)

If a holiday falls on a weekend, the company will observe it on the nearest weekday.

Personal Days
All employees receive 3 personal days per year that can be used for any reason without explanation. These days should be scheduled in advance when possible but can be used for unexpected personal matters.

Parental Leave
New parents (birth, adoption, or foster placement) are eligible for:

- Primary caregivers: 16 weeks paid leave
- Secondary caregivers: 8 weeks paid leave
- Must be used within the first year of the child's arrival
- Can be taken continuously or intermittently with manager approval

Bereavement Leave
Employees may take up to 5 paid days off for the loss of an immediate family member (spouse, child, parent, sibling). For the loss of an extended family member (grandparent, aunt, uncle, cousin), employees may take up to 3 paid days.

Additional unpaid bereavement leave may be granted on a case-by-case basis.

Sabbatical Program
Employees with 7+ years of tenure are eligible for a 4-week paid sabbatical to pursue personal growth, travel, or rest. Sabbaticals must be approved 6 months in advance and can be taken once every 7 years.

Jury Duty
TechCorp provides paid time off for employees summoned for jury duty. Employees must provide their jury summons to HR and are expected to return to work if dismissed early from jury service.

Questions
