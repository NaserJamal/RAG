Climate Tech Investments Hit Record $85 Billion in 2024

January 8, 2025 | By Marcus Thompson, Climate & Energy Correspondent

Venture capital and private equity investments in climate technology companies reached an all-time high of $85 billion in 2024, more than doubling the $38 billion invested in 2022, according to a report released today by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

The surge reflects growing confidence that climate tech has moved beyond experimental phase into commercially viable solutions that can generate substantial returns while addressing the climate crisis.

Key Investment Sectors

Carbon Capture and Storage led investments with $18 billion in funding. Companies developing direct air capture technology, which removes CO2 directly from the atmosphere, attracted particular interest. Climeworks, a Swiss company, raised $2.1 billion to build the world's largest direct air capture facility in Texas, capable of removing 1 million tons of CO2 annually.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel received $12 billion in investments. With aviation responsible for 2-3% of global emissions and few alternatives to liquid fuels, investors are betting on synthetic fuels made from captured carbon and renewable hydrogen. United Airlines announced plans to purchase 1 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually by 2030.

Battery Technology and Energy Storage attracted $15 billion. Next-generation batteries promise longer range for electric vehicles and better grid storage for renewable energy. QuantumScape, developing solid-state batteries, began pilot production of batteries that charge to 80% in 15 minutes and offer 50% more range than current lithium-ion batteries.

Green Hydrogen drew $14 billion in investments. Hydrogen produced using renewable energy could decarbonize heavy industry and shipping. Plug Power and BP announced a $3 billion joint venture to build green hydrogen production facilities across the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Nuclear Fusion reached a milestone with $8 billion in funding. While still years from commercialization, recent fusion experiments achieving net energy gain have convinced investors the technology is viable. Commonwealth Fusion Systems raised $1.8 billion to build the first commercial fusion power plant, targeting 2030 for operation.

Shifting Investor Sentiment

"Climate tech is no longer a charity play," explained Rachel Kim, partner at Breakthrough Energy Ventures. "We're seeing clear paths to profitability. Companies are signing multi-billion dollar offtake agreements before breaking ground. That's the confidence investors need."

The investment surge comes as governments worldwide implement carbon pricing and clean energy mandates, creating guaranteed markets for climate tech solutions.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which provides $369 billion in climate incentives, has been particularly influential. Tax credits for carbon capture, clean hydrogen, and renewable energy manufacturing have de-risked investments and accelerated project timelines.

European Green Deal policies and China's aggressive renewable energy targets have similarly boosted investment confidence globally.

Corporate Climate Commitments

Major corporations are investing directly in climate tech to meet net-zero commitments. Microsoft has committed to removing all its historical emissions by 2050 and is purchasing carbon removal from multiple startups. The company invested $1 billion in its Climate Innovation Fund, backing early-stage climate tech companies.

Amazon's $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund invested in 25 companies in 2024, including electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian and sustainable packaging startup Notpla.

"We can't wait for perfect solutions," said Kara Hurst, Amazon's Chief Sustainability Officer. "We need to invest in promising technologies now and help scale them to commercial viability."

Challenges Remain

Despite record funding, climate tech faces significant hurdles. Many technologies remain expensive compared to fossil fuel alternatives, requiring continued subsidy support.

Manufacturing capacity is a major bottleneck. The world needs to produce batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines at unprecedented scale. Building that manufacturing capacity requires time and additional capital.

Talent shortage is another constraint. Climate tech companies are competing with big tech for engineers and scientists, often unable to match Silicon Valley salaries.

"We can fund these companies, but can we staff them?" asked David Liu, managing director at Spring Lane Capital. "We need universities graduating 10 times more engineers with clean energy expertise."

Regulatory uncertainty poses risks. Changes in government policy could undermine project economics. The potential rollback of climate policies after elections creates investment hesitancy.

Regional Distribution

North America led investments with $38 billion, driven by U.S. Inflation Reduction Act incentives. Europe followed with $28 billion, particularly strong in offshore wind and green hydrogen. Asia attracted $19 billion, with China dominating battery and solar manufacturing investments.

Emerging markets received relatively little climate tech investment despite facing severe climate impacts. Africa received just $1.2 billion, mostly in solar mini-grids and agricultural technology.

"Climate justice requires investment in climate adaptation for vulnerable regions, not just mitigation technology for wealthy countries," noted Dr. Amina Osman, climate finance researcher at Oxford University.

Returns and Exits

Climate tech is beginning to generate exits that validate investor returns. Northvolt, a Swedish battery manufacturer, is planning an IPO at a $20 billion valuation. Ørsted, the Danish offshore wind company, has delivered 300% returns to early investors.

However, many climate tech investments remain in early stages, with returns years away. Patient capital is essential.

"This isn't a quick flip scenario," cautioned Kim. "Scaling deep tech takes 7-10 years minimum. Investors need conviction in the climate imperative and long-term value creation."

Looking Ahead

Industry analysts project climate tech investments could reach $150 billion annually by 2027 as technologies mature and costs decline.

The next wave of innovation is likely to focus on hard-to-abate sectors: steel, cement, shipping, and agriculture. These industries represent 30% of global emissions but have received relatively little climate tech investment to date.

"We've made great progress on electricity and passenger vehicles," said Liu. "The next decade is about decarbonizing everything else."

With climate impacts intensifying and costs of inaction escalating, the business case for climate tech is strengthening. Investors are betting that solving the climate crisis will be the greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century.
